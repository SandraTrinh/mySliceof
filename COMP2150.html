                    <h3>A summary...</h3>
                    <p>Here is a summary of a ‘level design’ assignment I completed for this unit.
                         I have to design three level of a game. The tools to do so are provided, 
                         I just need to draw a map or level plan for each level and make a story board 
                         for all the mechanic of the game. In the first level all the mechanic of the 
                         game must be introduced, and the level need to teach the player how to play
                          the game. In the later level their difficulty needs to increase in a 
                          reasonable rate while allowing the player to practice and use the skills
                           they just learnt in previous level(s).</p>

                    <h3>Level 1</h3>
                    <div>

                        <p id="p1">Here is the level plan for the first level of my game. <br><br>
                            Below is the cute stick figure that represent my game character the player will control.  </p>

                        <p id="p2">This level teaches the player all the differnt tools they can use and what to avoid.</p>
                        <div class="clearfix"></div>

                <article id="level2">
                    <h3>Level 2</h3>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/gamedesign/level2plan.PNG" alt="level two game plan">
                        <p>This is the second level's level plan. As you can see the level consist 
                            of three caves where the player can test their skills on the puzzles in them. 
                            The puzzles are not hard but does take some time to complete them.  </p>
                            <p>I would like to split these three caves into three mini games instead of putting them all in one level.</p>
                    </div>
                </article>
                <article id="level3">
                    <h3>Level 3</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>This is the final level. This level is different from the other level 
                            as it does not make the player to go underground but is wider. There are
                             many more enemy in this level and the puzzles are only slightly harder than 
                             level 2. This level also reveals more ways the mechanics in the games
                             can come together in different puzzles for the player to overcome.</p>
