                    <p>I study the culture surrounding the internet and the world 
                        wide web (WWW). This unit shows me the relationship between 
                        society and technology, how new media technologies shape our 
                        lives and evolve the mediascape

                        I have written a Major Essay debating how <b>fanfiction</b> is 
                        important and how that it being an online community evolved and change 
                        the relationship between themselves and copyright law. 
                        Here is the first two paragraph of the Major Essay I written.

                    <h3>Fan Fiction and AO3</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>The enforcement of copyright laws and strict censorship of content
                             for the transformative and creative work community
                              (<i>fan fiction/fandom community</i>) lead creators the need 
                              to create and move to site such as Archive of Our Own (AO3)
                               to defend their fair use (fair dealing) of media content 
                               (<i>Star Track, Harry Potter</i>) (<a href="#lothian">Lothian</a>, 2011, p.3). AO3 and 
                               other sites like it allows creators and consumers to share 
                               and consume fan work free from legal repercussions, they 
                               operate in the grey area between copyright law and fair 
                               dealing (<i>or fair use in the US</i>) (<a href="#fathallah">Fathallah</a>, 2020, p.858). 
                               Members of remix communities follow many social norms and 
                               behaviors primarily ‘<em>copyright norms</em>’ to protect their works 
                               and to protect the community (<a href="#fiesler">Fiesler & Bruckman</a>, 2019, p3-4).
                                The fandom community is an example of a disciplinary society, 
                                however the institutional surveillance of content on certain 
                                sites pushes members away while also bonding the community 
                                together against the common enemy of copyright laws and web 
                                site policy. The read/write culture’s (<a href="#lessig">Lessig</a>, L. 2008, p.28) 
                                of the fandom community are protected by community’s copyright
                                 norms practices on sites like AO3. The members behave like
                                  keen’s noble amateurs (<a href="#keen">Keen</a>, A. 2008, pp. 59) fighting 
                                  against expert’s view of copyright against their own view 
                                  on copyright. The control of copyright and the control of 
                                  social norms help shapes the land scape and freedom of 
                                  fandom creators and sites like AO3 help protect and promote 
                                  creators’ freedom. Whether freedom from prosecution or 
                                  freedom to remix media content AO3 is a safe space for 
                                  all members of the fan fiction community.

                                 The history of fandom (fan fiction, transformative work, remix culture etc)
                                 is long and started long before the internet existed but its story is 
                                 intertwined with copyright and those that want to control it. Websites 
                                 that hosted fan work have tried to control and censor the content for example,
                                  FanFiction.net’s cracked down on adult content in 2003, LiveJournal 
                                  purchased by a Russian company in late 2007 had “crack down on content 
                                  that might be illegal or obscene”, ended up deleting many journals 
                                  (<a href="#schwedel">Schwedel</a>, H. What were the specific things that drove people away from 
                                  LiveJournal? para.1) and Tumbler’s band on not safe for work (NSFW) 
                                  content (porn) in 2017 (<a href="#radulovic">Radulovic</a>, P., 2018 para.1). Like the pirates

                                   the “crack down” forces the community to boycott these sites and migrates to 
                                   other sites such as Archive of Our Own (AO3) and twitter. The Organization for 
                                   Transformative Work (OTW) formed in 2008 (<a href="#lothian">Lothian</a>, A. 2011, Screenshot, AO3 
                                   front page para.1) in response to the purge and restrictions to fan work and 
                                   Archive of Our Own (AO3) is a project they launched to give creators a reliable
                                    place in the “changing world of publishing and property” 
                                    (<a href="#lothian">Lothian</a>, A. 2011, 2. Ownership, para. 1).
